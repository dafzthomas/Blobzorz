This is a HTML5 <cavas> game I created for an assignment at university.

The game was inspired by Space Invaders in which there are side stepping enemies shooting down, while you shoot upwards to kill them. There are three levels with a Boss that shrinks when shot at (such original, much wow).

The game can be played either by downloading my code or at my website.
